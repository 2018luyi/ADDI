## ADDI: Predicting Alternatives for Drug-Drug Interactions with negative health effects

### Abstract
Investigating the interactions among various drugs is an indispensable issue in the field of computational biology. Scientific literature represents a rich source for the retrieval of knowledge about the interactions between biological concepts. Predicting drug-drug interaction (DDI) types will help biologists to evade hazardous drug interactions and encourage them to discover potential alternatives that increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity. In this paper, we propose ADDI as a generalpurpose  method that applies deep learning on PubMed abstracts to predict 86 interaction types among drugs. As an application, ADDI predicts alternatives for DDIs with Negative Health Effects types (NHE-types). Compared to the state-of-the-art method which used chemical structures as inputs to predict DDIs types, ADDI achieved more accuracy using only the textual content of the online papers. In addition to numerical evaluation, ADDI predicts alternatives for 180 DDIs with the types of Negative Health Effects.
